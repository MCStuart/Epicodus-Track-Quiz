          <h3 class="card-title">Java</h3>
          <p class="card-text">Java is the most commonly used programming language in the world! You should learn Java because you are a Jack-of-all Trades kind of person who wants to build anything, anytime, anywhere, for any platform. From a startup, to enterprise software at any of the FANG companies, you want to do it all, and Java can take you the whole way!</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">PHP</h3>
          <p class="card-text">PHP used to stand for "Personal Home Page" but has evolved over time to stand for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor," which is a recursive acronym. If this is your idea of a good time, then PHP is perfect for you. It's ugly and innelegant, but it works! If you can do it on a webserver, you can do it in PHP. PHP is the work-horse of the modern internet, powering the Business (back-end) logic of 80% of websites worldwide.</p>

          <p class="card-text">C# is big. Used and promoted by Microsoft, C# isn't going anywhere in the future. If you want stability of a mature language, with the powerful flexibility of its numerous use cases, then this language is definitly for you. Game developers, Mobile apps, cloud-based services, and enterprise software are all using C#. Learn this one here if you want the stability of of a developed, large community of users who want flexibility without risk.</p>

          <h3 class="card-title">Ruby</h3>
          <p class="card-text">Ruby is easy and fast. Easy for begginners to learn, and fast to develop with. Much like the hotrod car community, you build it how you want it, it looks great (to you) and its <em>really</em> fast to develop with (but runs like a snail). Don't ask to have a second one made, because you already built one and that's good enough. Working in a startup or another industry with short development life-cycles is perfect for someone who knows Ruby.</p>
